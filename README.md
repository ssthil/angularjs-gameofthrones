# Angularjs- Game of Thrones
a simple app has built with AngularJS and `anapioficeandfire.com/api` to show the detailed information of the Game of Thrones 

## How to install
- git clone https://github.com/ssthil/angularjs-gameofthrones.git
- cd angularjs-gameofthrones
- npm install
- node server.js

## Demo URL
https://angularjs-gameofthrones.herokuapp.com/
- since `anapioficeandfire.com/api` is running in http protocol we would expect Mixed Content blocker. So, for time being you can ignore this as warning and excute it.
### Steps to allow the mixed content
In Windows open the Run window (Win + R):
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe  --allow-running-insecure-content`
now you can run the web url which would work with warning rather than blocker.
